/**
 * The canonical [Json] instance for all Kursi wire messages.
 *
 * Configuration rationale:
 * - [ignoreUnknownKeys] = true — enables additive server-to-client evolution: a client built against an
 *   older schema safely ignores new fields added by a newer server. Critical for rolling updates.
 * - [classDiscriminator] = "type" — the polymorphic type key on every sealed-class frame. Stable name
 *   matches what clients log, trace, and display in network panels.
 * - [encodeDefaults] = false — keeps frames compact; default-valued fields (e.g. [WirePlayerView.schemaVersion])
 *   are omitted from frames produced by the current schema version and must be handled gracefully when absent.
 */
