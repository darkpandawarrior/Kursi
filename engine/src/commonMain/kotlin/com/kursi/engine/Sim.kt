/**
 * A player decision-maker for [SimHarness]'s own deterministic self-play fuzzer/property/golden tests.
 * It sees ONLY a [PlayerView] (never [GameState]) and the concrete legal intents — so a cheating
 * policy that reads opponents' hidden cards is structurally impossible.
 *
 * Renamed from the former engine-hosted `Policy` (ai→engine inversion, kmp-toolkit-family bots-policy
 * lane): the app-facing bot-policy abstraction now lives as a generic `Policy<View, Move>` in the
 * `com.siddharth.kmp:bots-policy` toolkit module (aliased to `com.kursi.ai.Policy` for Kursi's
 * concrete shape). [SimPolicy] stays engine-local — it only serves [SimHarness]'s own tests, never
 * consumed by `:ai`.
