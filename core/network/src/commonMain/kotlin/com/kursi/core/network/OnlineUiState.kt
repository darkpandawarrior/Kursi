 * A client can NEVER reconstruct an engine `PlayerView` (let alone a `GameState`) from the wire — there
 * is deliberately no `WirePlayerView.toEngine()` (the secrecy boundary, see Mappers.kt). So this state
 * carries the [WirePlayerView] the server sent, plus the same derived fields the offline `GameUiState`
 * exposes ([legalIntents], [recentEvents], [isHumanTurn], [isGameOver], [winnerSeat]). A later wave wires
 * this into the existing `GameScreen` by adapting these wire fields to whatever the screen reads — the
 * SHAPE matches field-for-field so that adaptation is mechanical, not a redesign.
 *
 * [view] is null until the first `StateUpdate` arrives (during [ConnectionState.Connecting]).
