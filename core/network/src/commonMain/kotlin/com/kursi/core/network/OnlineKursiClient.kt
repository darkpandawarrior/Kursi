/**
 * The high-level online client the UI layer talks to. It owns a single match connection's full
 * lifecycle and projects every server frame into one [OnlineUiState] flow whose shape mirrors the
 * offline `feature.game.GameUiState`, so a later wave can render an online match through the existing
 * `GameScreen` largely unchanged.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1. Connect by (host, port, roomCode) — a quick-match/private-room code OR a LAN-discovered address.
 * 2. Maintain the [ConnectionState] lifecycle (Connecting → Connected → Dropped → Reconnecting).
 * 3. AUTO-RECONNECT with capped exponential backoff, RESUMING the same seat (so the player keeps their
 *    hand) via [ClientMessage.JoinRoom.reconnectSeat].
 * 4. Expose [submit] / [pass] to send the human's intents.
 *
 * Threading: everything runs inside [scope] (typically a ViewModel scope). [uiState] is a hot
 * [StateFlow] safe to `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`.
 *
 * This class builds ONLY on the public client API ([KursiClient] / [KursiSession]) and the wire
 * protocol — it does not touch the engine, the AI, or any UI module.
 *
 * @param transportFactory Creates a fresh low-level [KursiClient] for EACH connection attempt. A factory
 *                         (not a single shared instance) is required because a dropped connection's
 *                         transport may be unusable for redialing — every reconnect needs a clean client,
 *                         and the old one is closed. Defaults to `::KursiClient`.
 * @param scope            The coroutine scope owning the connection loop.
 * @param config           Reconnect tuning (attempts, backoff). Defaults suit mobile networks.
