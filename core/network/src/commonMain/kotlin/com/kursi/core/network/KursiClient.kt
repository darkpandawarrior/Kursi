    /**
     * Opens a WebSocket connection to the Kursi server and returns a [KursiSession].
     *
     * The caller must:
     * 1. Collect [KursiSession.incoming] to receive [ServerMessage]s (the [ClientMessage.JoinRoom]
     *    handshake is sent internally as the first frame).
     * 2. Call [KursiSession.send] to submit [ClientMessage]s.
     *
     * The session terminates when [KursiSession.incoming] completes (server closes) or
     * the caller cancels the collecting coroutine. The underlying socket is then closed.
     *
     * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE — concurrent duplex pump:
     * The previous version drained the outgoing channel only when an inbound frame arrived
     * (it sat blocked in `for (frame in incoming)`). That stalled every client-initiated message
     * whenever the server had nothing to push — fatal for a turn-based game where the client must
     * be able to send an intent at any time. We now run the send loop and the receive loop as two
     * independent children of the [channelFlow]'s producer scope, so outbound frames flush
     * immediately regardless of inbound traffic.
     *
     * @param host          Hostname or IP of the Kursi server (e.g. "localhost", "10.0.0.1").
     * @param port          Port the server listens on (default 8080 per :server/App.kt).
     * @param roomCode      Short room code to join (e.g. "ABCD"). Matched case-insensitively by the server.
     * @param matchId       Stable match identifier to embed in every [ClientMessage]. Defaults to [roomCode].
     * @param reconnectSeat When non-null, asks the server to RESUME this seat (a seat previously held and
     *                      dropped). The server honours it if the seat is currently vacant. Null = fresh seat.
