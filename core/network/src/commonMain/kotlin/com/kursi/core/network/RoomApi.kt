/**
 * Thin REST client over the server's room-lifecycle HTTP endpoints (see :server `Routing.kt`):
 *
 *  - `POST /rooms/{playerCount}`      → creates a PRIVATE room, returns its short code (plain text).
 *  - `POST /quickmatch/{playerCount}` → returns the code of a WAITING public room of that size,
 *                                       creating one if none is open (public matchmaking pairing).
 *
 * The WebSocket `/play` join (and the whole match lifecycle) is owned by [OnlineKursiClient]; this is
 * only the pre-match handshake that turns a player's intent ("host a private room" / "find a public
 * game") into a room code the client can then connect to. Joining a private room BY code needs no REST
 * call at all — the code is shared out-of-band and passed straight to [OnlineKursiClient.connect].
 *
 * Errors are surfaced as a sealed [RoomResult] rather than thrown, so the UI can render an honest,
 * in-identity failure banner (the server unreachable, an invalid size) without a try/catch at every
 * call site.
 *
 * @param host server host (loopback for desktop testing, a LAN IP, or the cloud host).
 * @param port server port (default 8080 per :server `App.kt`).
 * @param clientFactory builds the [HttpClient] used for the two POSTs. Defaults to a plain client on
 *                      the platform engine; a fresh client is created per [RoomApi] and closed by [close].
