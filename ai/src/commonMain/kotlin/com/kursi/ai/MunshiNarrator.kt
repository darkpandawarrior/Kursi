/**
 * THE MUNSHI — the AI narrator (spec §8.1). Turns the redacted [PlayerView] the human is currently
 * looking at + the recent [GameEvent]s into ONE grounded, in-character sentence, or `null` when
 * nothing should upgrade the caller's own templated line.
 *
 * PROVIDER MATRIX / SELECTION POLICY (spec §8.5): on-device is tried first (auto-detected, zero
 * setup for the player) → any BYOK cloud provider [cloudConfig] explicitly opts into (inert by
 * default — a null API key simply never enters the chain, per
 * [com.siddharth.kmp.llmchat.buildProviderChain]) → the templated floor, which this class reports
 * back to its caller as `null` rather than any generated text. That keeps tier 3 truthful: the real
 * templated copy lives at the call site (e.g. `BeatHeadline.headlineFor`), not here.
 *
 * ENCAPSULATION: none of [com.siddharth.kmp.llmchat]'s types appear in this class's own public
 * surface (only plain KMP/engine types do), so a caller like `:feature:game` never needs that
 * BYOK/on-device dependency graph on its own compile classpath — it only ever sees `String?`.
 *
 * LATENCY RULE (spec §8.6): this is a plain suspend call with its own internal timeout. It never
 * blocks a beat — the caller's templated line has already rendered synchronously by the time this
 * is invoked; a non-null result here only ever upgrades that line in place.
 *
 * GUARDRAILS (spec §8.6) — enforced by what this class does NOT do: it never sees or receives
 * hidden cards ([view]/[events] are already redacted/public-only upstream), never writes to
 * `humanIntentLog`, never mutates `GameState`, and never gates a legal action. Callers must not
 * fold the result into any of those, and must not persist it into a replay record — it is
 * display-only, always regenerable, never part of the deterministic replay contract.
