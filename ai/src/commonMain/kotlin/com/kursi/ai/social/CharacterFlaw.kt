/**
 * A persona's exploitable psychological FLAW — the lever a manipulator (the human player, in
 * narrative mode) can pull to make a bot act against its own interest.
 *
 * Flaws are derived *deterministically* from a bot's [PersonalityProfile] knobs, so a persona's
 * flaws are a stable function of who they already are — Bhai Teja (vindictive enforcer) is hot-headed
 * and vengeful; Netaji Vachan (high-bluff schemer) is an egomaniac; Babu Filewala (cautious banker)
 * is greedy-cautious. Nothing here touches the deterministic engine; flaws only ever bias a bot's
 * choice AMONG already-legal intents (see `SocialDirector.nudgeBotIntent`).
