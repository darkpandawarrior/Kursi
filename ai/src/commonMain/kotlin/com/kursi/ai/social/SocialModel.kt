 * fresh copy so the director can keep a clean history if it ever needs one.

 * @property stances    directed (observer → target) feelings.
 * @property threat     table-wide "this seat needs to go" pressure per seat — the conspiracy field.
 *                      Whoever carries the most threat is who the table wants to gang up on.
 * @property alliances  seat → its current pact partner (symmetric; null = unaligned). At most one each.
 * @property agitation  seat → flaw "heat" `[0,1]`: how primed the bot is to act on its flaw (blunder).
