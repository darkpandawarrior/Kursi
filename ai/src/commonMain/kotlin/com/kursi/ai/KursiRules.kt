 * Adapts the engine's free-function API (whoActsNext/legalIntents/applyIntent/redact) to the generic
 * [GameRules] contract, so [com.siddharth.kmp.botspolicy.Ismcts] can drive Kursi self-play without
 * importing `com.kursi.engine.*` itself.
 *
 * Lives in `:ai`, NOT `:engine` — the sketch that kicked off this inversion suggested `:engine` host
 * this wiring, but `:engine` must stay dependency-free (the `checkEnginePurity` tripwire) and cannot
 * see [GameRules] without depending on `:ai`, which would cycle back against `:ai`'s existing
 * dependency on `:engine`. `:engine` itself is untouched by this step except for the `Policy` →
 * `SimPolicy` rename in `Sim.kt` (that rename is unrelated to this adapter — it just frees the name).
