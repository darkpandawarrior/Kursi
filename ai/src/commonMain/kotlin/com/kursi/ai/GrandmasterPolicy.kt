/**
 * GRANDMASTER tier AI — a strict superset of [ExpertPolicy], one rung above it.
 *
 * Two levers make it genuinely stronger than Expert, both deterministic given seed + budget:
 *
 *  1. DEEPER SEARCH. It runs the same [IsmctsSearch] but on a deeper budget than the in-game Expert
 *     budget — more iterations and a deeper rollout horizon — so the tree resolves longer tactical
 *     lines (multi-turn coin races, forced-reveal sequences) that Expert's shallower budget truncates.
 *     This is the edge that holds even with NO opponent read (e.g. in the seeded strength sims where
 *     events are never fed back), because it is pure search depth.
 *
 *  2. OPPONENT-MODEL EXPLOITATION. Where Expert plays close to Nash, Grandmaster deliberately deviates
 *     toward exploiting the per-opponent [StyleEstimate] the [BeliefModel] infers from observed play:
 *
 *       a. It passes an [exploitGain] > 1 into the search so the leaf evaluation ([staticEval] via
 *          [StyleContext]) bends *harder* toward the read — a high-aggression opponent's material looms
 *          larger (race to neutralise them), a trigger-happy table discounts our concealment more.
 *
 *       b. Before search, a confident-read OVERRIDE layer can deviate from the Nash-ish search choice:
 *            • CHALLENGE more vs a claimant whose inferred bluffRate is high (they lie often → call them).
 *            • BLUFF more (push a claim the search would skip) vs a table whose inferred challengeRate is
 *              low (nobody calls → bluffs are nearly free).
 *            • INVESTIGATE / Jaanch the STRONGEST opponent to strip information from the biggest threat.
 *          The override only fires when the read is backed by enough evidence; with no read it is inert,
 *          so Grandmaster degrades gracefully to "Expert with a deeper budget".
 *
 * Determinism: every random draw flows through the seeded [Rng]; the override consults only the
 * deterministic belief counters; the deeper budget is fixed. Same seed + budget ⇒ same line of play.
 *
 * Like Expert, the caller should feed game events via [observe] so the belief model — and therefore the
 * exploitation — actually has a read to work with.
