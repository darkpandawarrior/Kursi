 * Everything the UI is allowed to render about ONE opponent's "read", derived ENTIRELY from
 * PUBLIC information — the table-visible claim/block/reveal history accumulated in a [BotMemory]
 * (the human's own decision-coach belief). It NEVER contains an opponent's hidden cards.
 *
 * ## What each field means
 * - [posterior]      P(this opponent's face-down slot is each role), folding the deck-composition
 *                    prior with public claim/reveal evidence. Sums to ~1.0 across [Role].
 * - [pHolds]         P(opponent holds each role in *at least one* of their face-down cards
 *                    (1 − (1 − pSlot)^faceDownCount). NOT a probability distribution — each entry
 *                    is independent and they can sum past 1.0.
 * - [claimStats]     Per-role claim history with bluff-caught / proven counts.
 * - [bluffRate]      Inferred P(this opponent's next claim is a bluff) — the EWMA-smoothed style
 *                    scalar from observed bluff-caught frequency.
 * - [style]          The full inferred [StyleEstimate] (bluffRate / aggression / challengeRate).
 * - [totalClaims] / [bluffsCaught]  Headline counters for a quick "shady-meter".
 *
 * SECRECY: every field here is a function of public events only. Construct via [OpponentInsight.from].
