/**
 * EXPERT tier AI — Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS) over determinized worlds.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *  - [BeliefModel]: Bayesian posterior over opponents' hidden roles, updated from observable events.
 *  - [Determinizer]: Samples a consistent full [GameState] from a [PlayerView] using the belief model.
 *  - [IsmctsSearch]: ISMCTS tree search — builds a shared tree across many determinizations so that
 *    moves are selected based on their expected value across the space of possible hidden states.
 *  - Fallback to [HardPolicy] if search errors or returns an illegal move.
 *
 * The caller can optionally call [observe] after each game event to keep the belief model updated.
 *
 * Implements both [Policy] and [SimPolicy] — see [EasyPolicy]'s KDoc for why.
