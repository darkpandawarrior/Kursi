/**
 * PROVIDER MATRIX TIER 3 (spec §8.5) — the always-available floor every selection chain falls back
 * to. Deliberately returns a blank completion rather than any generated text: callers (e.g.
 * [com.kursi.ai.MunshiNarrator]) treat a blank/absent AI line as "no upgrade" and simply keep
 * showing their own deterministic templated string, which is what makes this tier truthful — the
 * actual templated copy lives at each call site (e.g. [com.kursi.feature.game] `KursiVoice`), not
 * here. This object exists only so `:ai` always has a non-null, always-[isAvailable] last resort to
 * plug into [com.siddharth.kmp.llmchat.buildProviderChain]'s `fallback` slot.
