/**
 * Strength regression guards for the EXPERT (ISMCTS) tier across table sizes.
 *
 * Why this exists: the ISMCTS evaluation function and rollout horizon are tuning-sensitive. A future
 * "harmless" refactor of [IsmctsSearch.staticEval], the information-asymmetry term, or
 * [effectiveRolloutHorizon] could silently weaken the bot while every functional test stays green
 * (games still complete, no crashes). These seeded sims pin Expert's edge over Hard at 2p, 4p, and 10p
 * so any such regression trips a red test instead of shipping a weaker bot.
 *
 * Thresholds are deliberately *conservative* floors — comfortably below observed strength so normal
 * run-to-run variance never flakes them, but high enough that a real regression (Expert collapsing to
 * Hard-parity or worse) is caught. At an n-player table a policy with no edge wins 1/n of the time, so
 * each floor is stated as "meaningfully above fair share".
 *
 * Budget is sized to stay within the configured 4g JVM test heap (see KursiKmpPureConventionPlugin):
 * fewer iterations than the in-game budget, game counts kept modest, especially at 10p where each game
 * is far heavier.
