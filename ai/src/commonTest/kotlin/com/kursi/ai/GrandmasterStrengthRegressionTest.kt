/**
 * Strength regression guards for the GRANDMASTER tier — it must out-play EXPERT head-to-head.
 *
 * Why this exists: GRANDMASTER is "one rung above Expert". The two levers that buy that edge — a
 * deeper ISMCTS budget and the opponent-model exploitation gain — are both tuning-sensitive. A future
 * refactor could silently collapse Grandmaster to Expert-parity while every functional test stays
 * green (games complete, no crashes). These seeded sims pin Grandmaster's edge over Expert at 2p and
 * 4p so any such regression trips red.
 *
 * Note on the exploitation read: [SimHarness.playOut] never calls [GrandmasterPolicy.observe], so the
 * belief-model-driven exploitation override is INERT in these sims (no events are fed back). The edge
 * measured here therefore comes purely from the DEEPER SEARCH BUDGET — which is exactly what we want to
 * guard, because it is the part that holds unconditionally, even against an opponent we have no read on.
 * The exploitation layer is covered separately by [GrandmasterExploitTest] (it is strictly additive).
 *
 * Budgets are sized to stay within the configured 4g JVM test heap (see KursiKmpPureConventionPlugin):
 * Grandmaster gets a strictly deeper iteration/horizon budget than the Expert opponent, both bounded by
 * the iteration cap (not the wall clock) so the result is deterministic across machines.
