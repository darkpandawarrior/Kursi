/**
 * Regression tests for [GameViewModel.submitIntent]'s legality guard.
 *
 * History: a double-tap (or any tap landing after the turn had already advanced into a
 * reaction window) dispatched a [GameAction.Submit] the engine considered illegal. The engine
 * threw [IllegalStateException] ("Intent rejected by engine: expected Block/Pass ..."), which
 * was uncaught and crashed the whole desktop window. The VM now ignores any intent not in the
 * engine's current legal set (plus a try/catch backstop). These tests lock that in.
 *
 * Seed 1 + seat 0 deterministically gives the human the opening turn (see GameSessionTest T3).
