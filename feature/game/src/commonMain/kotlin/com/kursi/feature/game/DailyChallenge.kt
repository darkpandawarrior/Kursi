/**
 * M6d — the deterministic Daily Challenge (Aaj ki Chunauti).
 *
 * A daily is a pure function of the calendar [epochDay] (days since 1970-01-01, supplied by the
 * UI/VM — never derived from a clock in pure code). The SAME date yields the SAME challenge for
 * everyone: a fixed seed, player count, and difficulty. The persona lineup follows for free, because
 * the in-game [com.kursi.ai.persona.PersonaAssigner] derives the roster deterministically from the
 * seed + difficulty — so by fixing the seed and difficulty, the daily fixes the whole table.
 *
 * Determinism note: derivation uses only integer arithmetic on [epochDay] (a SplitMix64-style hash),
 * so it is identical across platforms (JVM / iOS / wasm) and across runs.
