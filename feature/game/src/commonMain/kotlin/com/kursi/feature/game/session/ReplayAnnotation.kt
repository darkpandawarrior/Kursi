/**
 * ReplayAnnotation — the advisor's read of ONE human decision in a replayed match (M6c §2).
 *
 * This is teach-by-review: at each human-decision frame the [ReplaySession] runs the FAIR
 * [MoveAdvisor] on that exact moment (redacted — it never peeks at hidden cards, exactly as live),
 * grades the move the human actually played against the advisor's recommended best, and surfaces:
 *  - [playedLabel] / [bestLabel] — what was played vs what the coach would have played,
 *  - [evGapPct] — the win-probability the choice bled vs the best move (0 when it WAS the best),
 *  - [verdict] — a coarse grade ([Verdict]) used to colour the annotation chrome,
 *  - [beliefHinglish] / [beliefEnglish] — the voiced belief read of the moment, in identity
 *    ("Teen NETA hisaab mein the — lalkaar faayde ka tha" / "All 3 NETA were accounted for — the
 *    challenge was favourable").
 *
 * Pure data — no Compose. The UI layer picks the language line and renders the chrome.
