 * doesn't read RECKLESS by [accuracyPct]/[avgEvLostPct], the same thresholds core/prefs' DecisionGrade
 * uses). Takes primitives rather than a core/prefs type so feature/game stays free of a core:prefs
 * dependency (the same seam the DensityLayer String↔enum mapping already uses — see KursiApp.kt).
 * Never advances a player who has [manuallySet] their density layer themselves — a manual choice
 * (Settings, or any future in-game override) always wins; this function only ever proposes moving
 * FOCUS → GUIDED → ANALYST, never sideways or backward, and never past ANALYST. Callers persist the
 * result only when it differs from [current] (see [com.kursi.shared.KursiApp]).
