/**
 * ONLINE SESSION ADAPTER — drives the existing offline [GameScreen] from an [OnlineKursiClient].
 *
 * It is the online counterpart of [GameViewModel]: it exposes the SAME `StateFlow<GameUiState?>` the
 * screen already renders and accepts the SAME [GameAction] the screen already dispatches, but its source
 * of truth is a live server connection rather than a local engine reducer.
 *
 * THE BRIDGE, in two directions:
 *  - INBOUND  (server → screen): every [OnlineUiState] the client projects is mapped into a
 *    [GameUiState]. The wire-typed view/intents/events are re-hydrated into engine types via
 *    [OnlineUiState.toEngineProjection] (see :core:network), then dressed with the online-specific
 *    fields: synthesized opponent personas (the wire carries no names) and the connection [status].
 *  - OUTBOUND (screen → server): a [GameAction.Submit] carries an engine [com.kursi.engine.Intent]
 *    already built against the rendered engine view — including the CardId-addressed choices
 *    ([com.kursi.engine.Intent.ChooseInfluenceToLose] / [com.kursi.engine.Intent.ChooseExchange]),
 *    whose CardIds came from `WirePlayerView.myCards` / `Exchange.drawn` and therefore round-trip
 *    losslessly back to the server via [com.kursi.engine.Intent.toWire].
 *
 * CONNECTION-LIFECYCLE: [status] is a derived [OnlineConnectionStatus] the screen surfaces as an
 * always-legible banner (Connecting / Waiting-for-players / In-game / Reconnecting / Opponent-disconnected
 * / Server-lost). The ALWAYS-LEGIBLE tenet: the player always knows the connection state AND whose turn
 * it is. The decision coach / moments operate on [state] exactly as offline (they read the engine view).
 *
 * The DECISION COACH is intentionally NOT wired here: online advice would require the server-authoritative
 * search and is out of scope for the bridge. [GameUiState.advice] / [GameUiState.opponentInsights] stay
 * empty, which the screen renders gracefully (it lights coach surfaces up only when present). A later wave
 * may compute table-public-info coaching on the reconstructed engine view.
 *
 * Threading: everything runs in [scope] (typically a ViewModel scope). [state] / [status] are hot
 * StateFlows safe to `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`. Call [connect] to open, [close] to tear down.
 *
 * @param client the connection lifecycle owner (already constructed with the same [scope]).
 * @param scope  the coroutine scope owning the projection collector.
