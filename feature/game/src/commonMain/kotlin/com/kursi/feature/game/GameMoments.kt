// GameMoments.kt — bridges the engine event stream to the designsystem "moment"
// stamp-theatre framework. Pure presentation glue; does NOT touch :engine / :ai logic.
//
//  - mapEventToMoment(): engine GameEvent  →  KursiMoment (License Raj stamp theatre).
//  - rememberSeatIdResolver(): engine PlayerId  →  SeatId (index in view.players).
//  - GameMomentLayer(): a BoxScope overlay that owns a MomentHost, builds proportional
//    TableAnchors from the host Box size, and fires moments as new events arrive.
//
// Mount inside the SAME Box that holds the felt table — layered ABOVE the felt surface
// but BELOW the action dock so the dock stays tappable.
