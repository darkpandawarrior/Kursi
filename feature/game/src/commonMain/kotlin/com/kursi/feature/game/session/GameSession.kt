/**
 * Offline game coordinator — the authoritative source of [GameState] for a single local game.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Holds the full (un-redacted) [GameState].
 * - Auto-advances bot seats between human turns by calling their [Policy] with ONLY the
 *   bot's redacted [com.kursi.engine.PlayerView] — bots never see the full state.
 * - Exposes only a [GameUiState] (built from `redact(state, humanSeat)`) to callers.
 *
 * # M5 PASS-AND-PLAY
 * The session is generalized from a single human seat to a SET of [humanSeats]. The advance loop
 * pauses whenever the NEXT actor is ANY human seat (not just one). Bots fill every other seat. The
 * redacted [GameUiState] is always built for the seat that must act next ([activeHumanSeat]), so each
 * hot-seat player only ever sees their OWN hand — the engine's [redact] guarantees secrecy. The
 * single-human constructor delegates to the set form with `setOf(humanSeat)`.
 *
 * @param config           Game configuration (e.g. [GameConfig.forPlayers]).
 * @param seed             Deterministic RNG seed for the initial state.
 * @param humanSeats       The set of [PlayerId]s that humans control (>=1). Pass-and-play passes
 *                         more than one; vs-AI passes exactly one.
 * @param bots             Policy per non-human seat. Every non-human alive seat MUST have an entry.
 * @param opponentPersonas Optional persona display info keyed by PlayerId (shown in the UI).

     *  - [GameEvent.CoinsTransferred]→ a Steal: the recipient hit the giver (a softer, weight-1 hit).
