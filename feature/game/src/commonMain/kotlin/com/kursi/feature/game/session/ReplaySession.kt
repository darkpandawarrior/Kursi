/**
 * ReplaySession — deterministic step-by-step review of a FINISHED match (M6c §2).
 *
 * # The determinism contract
 * The engine + bots are a pure function of (seed + the human intent log): bots derive every move from
 * their redacted [com.kursi.engine.PlayerView], and all RNG is carried in [GameState]. So replaying
 * the human log onto a fresh [GameSession] reconstructs the EXACT same sequence of [GameState]s as the
 * original live game — that is the entire review/replay guarantee, and the same property [GameSession.restore]
 * relies on for resume (M3 §2).
 *
 * # What a "step" is
 * A live [GameSession] pauses control exactly at the points the HUMAN had to decide (plus the terminal
 * GameOver). Those are the meaningful review stops: the Review UI walks them with [next]/[prev]/[stepTo],
 * each yielding the [GameUiState] the human saw at that decision — redacted EXACTLY as during live play
 * via [com.kursi.engine.redact], so review respects secrecy (a reviewer never sees hidden cards they
 * couldn't see live). [humanDecisionIndices] marks which steps were genuine human decisions (vs the
 * final game-over frame), so the UI can stop on them.
 *
 * # Reconstruction (eager, deterministic)
 * On [build], we replay the log one human intent at a time onto a fresh session, snapshotting the
 * redacted [GameUiState] at the start of each human decision and then at the terminal state. Replay is
 * eager and cheap (no search on the human side — the human's moves are the recorded log; only the bots
 * between them run their policies, exactly as live). Stepping is then O(1) index lookup.
 *
 * SECRECY: every captured frame is built by [GameSession] from `redact(state, viewerSeat)`. The full
 * [GameState] sequence is captured ONLY for the determinism test ([gameStates]) — the UI never sees it.
