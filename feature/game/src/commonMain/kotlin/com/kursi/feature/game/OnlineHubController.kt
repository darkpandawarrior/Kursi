/**
 * ONLINE-HUB CONTROLLER — the pre-match orchestration the [com.kursi.feature.game] module owns so the
 * UI layer (`:cmp-shared`'s OnlineHubScreen) stays a pure renderer of [OnlineHubUiState].
 *
 * It turns a player's intent — host a PRIVATE room, JOIN by code, find a public QUICK-MATCH, or BROWSE
 * the LAN — into a live waiting-room and, once seats fill, an authoritative [OnlineGameAdapter] driving
 * the existing in-game table (the Bridge). Three collaborators, each from `:core:network`:
 *
 *  - [RoomApi]        — the REST handshake (`POST /rooms/{n}` / `POST /quickmatch/{n}`) that mints a code.
 *  - [LanDiscoverer]  — the LAN browse flow (mDNS/UDP-beacon) yielding [LanHost]s to join directly.
 *  - [OnlineKursiClient] — the WebSocket connection + lobby/seat lifecycle once a code is in hand.
 *
 * THE LOBBY: after a code is obtained (or a LAN host picked), [connect] opens the socket and projects
 * the connection lifecycle into [OnlineHubUiState.lobby]. While [ConnectionState.Connecting] /
 * Connected-without-a-view, the player sits in the waiting room (who has joined, the share code). The
 * moment the server sends the first `StateUpdate` (room full → match started), [OnlineHubUiState.started]
 * flips true and the UI routes into the online table built on [adapter].
 *
 * Threading: all work runs in [scope] (a ViewModel scope in the app, a test scope in tests). Every
 * exposed field is a hot [StateFlow] safe to `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`. Call [close] to tear down.
 *
 * @param scope          coroutine scope owning every job here and the underlying client.
 * @param clientFactory  builds the [OnlineKursiClient] (defaults to one bound to [scope]).
 * @param roomApiFactory builds a [RoomApi] for a (host, port) — overridable in tests.
 * @param lanDiscoverer  the LAN browser (defaults to the platform actual).
